# Bus Shelter Helper (Ottawa public transit)
The purpose of this Android application was to provide the user with easy access to information regarding their local OCTranspo stops.
This was completed was part of an independent study class, where my goal was to learn Android development through the creation of this application. The end result was an application that utilized an SQLite database in order to cache frequent stop information, as well as another SQLite database to store offline data retrieved from the OCTranspo API. It would also query this API in order to get GPS adjusted stop times, which it would return to the user. The report was structured in a way that allowed the reader to create follow the creation of the app and attempt it themselves. For this reason the project was branched after each milestone (the UI, the Database, and the API).
